        <h3>Suppose you are the owner of a restaurant and unfortunately your turn out for a particular day comes out to be extremely less than what you had expected! What next..all your matar paneer, dal makhni, pizza and chowmin remains unused in a way that if kept more than 24 hours will get spoiled! 
        What to do?? Let the food get wasted and throw it in the bin the next day!
        This sounds harsh but this is what most of the restaurants do..
        According to the sources, around 80 billion pounds of food is thrown away every year along the entire supply chain of a food product – i.e. from agriculture to retail, to hospitality, to private households. And 40 % of the waste comes from restaurants, grocery stores and food service companies.

        Worried about how to tackle it!!!
        FoodHut is here! We are bringing restaurants, NGO’s, retailers,orphans and farmers together to recycle and use the waste food.</h3>

        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">
            <h3>The fact that substantial amounts of food are produced but not eaten by humans has substantial negative impacts: environmentally, socially and economically. Today, the globe wastes or loses nearly a third of the food it generates, while approximately 690 million people remain hungry. If we keep throwing away 1/3 of the produced food, we’ll need 2 planets to feed 10 billion people in 2050. Reusing and recycling waste food is one of the most effective solution to this problem.</h3>

            <h3>Our website provides a platform to:</h3>
            <h3>1) The farmers/ wholesalers to directly sell unused raw food items to nearby retailers.</h3>
            <h3>2) The restaurant owners to donate fresh prepared food to NGO’s, orphans and old age homes around the locality.</h3>
            <h3>3) The common people to dump the spoiled food to the dumping compost pits near.</h3>
            <h3>4) Moreover, even the grocery shops can donate the bakery items close to expiry date to NGO’s for same day consumption.</h3>
